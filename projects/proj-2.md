I worked on Sencity as an intern with <a href="http://bresslergroup.com" target="_blank">BresslerGroup</a>. Sencity was a project to create a network of distributed IoT nodes and interpret their data into a user-friendly representation of crowd traffic at different tourist hotspots across Philadelphia. Each Sencity node was equipped with a wide of array of sensors, such as time of flight, ambient light, sound, GPS, and temperature, as well as a LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) radio. LoRaWAN is a new technology and protocol utilizing sub-GHz frequencies to transmit data at long ranges while having a low power budget. The tradeoff made is a very poor network bandwidth, on the order of a couple of kilobits per second. This technology was perfect for Sencity, as it allowed us to deploy the devices across the entire city of Philadelphia with small battery packs, and receive periodic data updates from a single central access point. 


I worked on the board debug and the firmware development processes for the device.
